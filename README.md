 <h1>User Problem:</h1>
 <p>I want to address the problem many pet owners have when it comes to handling their pets. There is no readily accessible site or app that allows pet owners to easily keep track of pet medical records or determine what kind of food is good or bad for the pet. It can include a place for setting reminders on taking the pet in for check-ups, connected to local pet stores via maps, and allow for categorizing the type of pet. This site would provide training plans for dogs and any additional information people may look for when considering getting a pet.</p>
 
 <h1>Users:</h1>
 <p>The users are any people who own pets or are looking into getting one.</p>
 
 <h1>Comparison:</h1>
 <p>The more popular pet stores, such as Pet Smart, have their own sites for displaying some ofthis information and for booking appointments. However, this idea is very different from what is currently out there while taking ideas from other, similar sites.</p>
